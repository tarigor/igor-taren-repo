## Theory:

- JUnit
- Spring IOC
- Hibernate

## Task:

Develop a Restful WEB project that fully implements one of the sets of requirements described below.

## Description

- User registration in the system (user and administrator).
- Profile editing.
- View a list of advertisements. Search and filtering.
- Ability to add/edit/delete ads.
- Ability to leave comments under ads.

- Seller rating system influencing the position of seller ads in search results. The lower the rating, the lower the ad
  in the results.
- User sales history.

## General Requirements for the Assignment:

#### Mandatory:

- The assignment must adhere to all canonical principles of writing Java programs and Java naming conventions.
- Adherence to MVC principles.
- Adherence to the principles of "High Cohesion" and "Loose Coupling."
- Well-thought-out modular structure (package structure).
- Reasonable use of multiple design patterns.
- Have a database diagram.
- The database must be brought to at least the 3rd normal form.
- Have a database initialization script (SQL).
- Have JUnit tests covering the main functionality.
- Have an exception handling system.
- Have a multi-level logging system.
- Have scripts for automatically building the application into a ready-to-use WAR or JAR file.
- Have detailed, step-by-step documentation on installing and deploying the application.
- Have a detailed user and role system (e.g., regular user and administrator).

#### Preferred:

- Compliance with the planned deadlines (4 weeks).
- Sending emails about lost passwords (emails generated by Velocity).
- Presence of project documentation (Javadoc, good UML diagrams).
- Presence of data validation.
- Technical Requirements for the Assignment:

#### Mandatory:

- Use Hibernate or MyBatis for working with the database.
- Use Maven or Gradle.
- Use MySQL, Postgres, or Oracle (free limited version).
- Use Spring for configuring and implementing "inversion of control."
- Use JUnit for writing Unit tests.
- Use Spring Security for user authorization.

## Defense of the Assignment:

- For admission to defense, you need to:
- Pass theory exams.
- Complete all practical assignments.
- For defense, you need to prepare:
- Archive with the application.
- Scripts for building the application.
- Scripts for initializing the database.
- Documentation on installing the project.
- The required version of Tomcat (if used).

## During defense, you need to:

- Build the project into a WAR/JAR file using Maven/Gradle.
- Install the database using prepared scripts.
- Run the application in Tomcat.
- Demonstrate the functionality of all assignment points.
- Demonstrate the completion of all project requirements.
- Explain the structure and principles of the application.
- Demonstrate project documentation.
- Discuss the technologies used and their peculiarities.
- Answer all questions about the code of the application.

## The defense may be considered unsuccessful if:

- The project could not be built or run.
- Specification points are not fully completed or completed incorrectly.
- Mandatory requirements for the assignment are not fully completed or completed incorrectly.
- Lack of knowledge about the technologies used in the project.
- Lack of knowledge of the project code.

## An unfinished project can be accepted only if all of the following points are fulfilled:

- Excellent theoretical exams.
- Very good code and database design.
- Confident understanding of the code and project structure

## DB scheme
